h1. Welcome to your personal wiki!

Leaf is a small, fast, PHP wiki that I made because I really needed a place to store my notes, snippets, ideas, and so on. I've tried a lot of personal wikis and note-taking applications in the past, but since I have peculiar needs, none of them really suited me, so I rolled my own. With blackjack and whatnot.
